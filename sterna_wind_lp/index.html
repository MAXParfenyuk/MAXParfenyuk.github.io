                <p>With climate change rising, consumers and companies are initiating the transition to renewable energy solutions. Many factors have made this market grow like never before, making it increasingly difficult for companies to effectively meet the demand for their services. </p>
                <p class="mt-8">This sector is growing along with the number and size of projects, which forces companies to digitalize their business processes. 
                    We decided to focus on the most complex and labour-intensive process, namely, the construction of wind turbines.</p>
                <p class="mt-8">The large number of subcontractors and the scale of construction sites results in numerous activities happening in parallel in a very fast pace environment. It makes it easy to loose track of hours spent on a specific task by a specific subcontractor and ends up in unnecessary extra cost, rather than analyzing whether subcontractors are spending their time productively</p>
